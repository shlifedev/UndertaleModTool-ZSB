    "ko": "When you went to the radio station you must have noticed the building there, maybe you even tried to go inside.\nWord on the street is that it was an old lab for the Crimson Corporation.\nThe entrance is locked and you need a key card to get in, unfortunately none of us here have one and I don't think the Crimson Corporation will give us one.\nSo I sent my man, Marat Loginov, to look for the key. He seems to have found a damaged one but we may be able to fix it or make a copy.\nMy man is operating in the industrial zone, he has a small base in the north-west, among the abandoned wagons. I haven't heard from him in days, but that's not unusual.\nGo to the industrial area, find him and bring me the key."
